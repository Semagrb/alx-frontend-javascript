# 0x04. TypeScript

Welcome to the 0x04 TypeScript project! In this project, we delve into the world of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of various TypeScript concepts and how to apply them in your projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without relying on external resources:

1. **Basic Types in TypeScript**
   - Understand and utilize TypeScript's basic data types such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, etc.

2. **Interfaces, Classes, and Functions**
   - Define and implement interfaces to describe the shape of objects.
   - Create classes and understand how they interact with interfaces.
   - Define functions with TypeScript, including optional and default parameters.

3. **Working with the DOM and TypeScript**
   - Manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using TypeScript.
   - Understand type definitions for DOM elements and events.

4. **Generic Types**
   - Define generic types to create reusable components and functions.
   - Understand the benefits of generics in TypeScript.

5. **Namespaces**
   - Organize code using namespaces to prevent naming collisions.
   - Understand when and how to use namespaces effectively.

6. **Merging Declarations**
   - Learn how TypeScript merges multiple declarations of the same identifier across different files.

7. **Using Ambient Namespace to Import External Libraries**
   - Utilize ambient namespaces to import external libraries without type definitions.

8. **Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript**
   - Implement nominal typing patterns in TypeScript for stricter type checking.
