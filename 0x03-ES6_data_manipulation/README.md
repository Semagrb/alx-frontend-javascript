# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Overview
Welcome to project 0x03! In this project, we'll be diving into ES6 data manipulation using JavaScript. Together, we'll explore how to work with arrays using methods like map, filter, and reduce. We'll also learn about typed arrays and different data structures such as Set, Map, and WeakMap.

### Project Details
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** April 29, 2024, 4:00 AM
- **End Date:** May 1, 2024, 4:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** April 29, 2024, 4:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Scheduled at the project deadline

## Resources
To make the most out of this project, let's make sure we're familiar with the following concepts:
- [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
- [Typed Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays)
- [Set Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
- [Map Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
- [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to achieve the following goals:
- Understand and confidently use map, filter, and reduce methods on arrays
- Gain familiarity with typed arrays in JavaScript
- Grasp the concepts behind Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures and their applications

## Requirements
To ensure we're on the right track, let's stick to the following guidelines:
- My code should run on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- I can use editors like vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code
- All my files should end with a new line
- Don't forget the mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Save my code files with the .js extension
- Test my code using Jest with the command `npm run test`
- Make sure my code follows linting rules using ESLint
- Verify that my code passes all tests and lint checks; I can do this with `npm run full-test`
- Remember to export all functions

## Getting Started
Let's kick off our learning journey with these steps:
1. Clone this repository to my local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start working on my project files within the `src` directory.
5. Test my code using `npm run test`.
6. Ensure lint compliance with `npm run lint`.
7. Finally, verify the entire project with `npm run full-test`.

Feel free to ask for help or clarification on any aspect of the project. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸŒ±
