# ES6 Promises Mastery

Welcome to the 0x01 project focusing on mastering ES6 Promises in JavaScript. By the project's end, you'll wield a solid understanding of Promises and related concepts, crucial for modern JavaScript development.

## Project Overview

- **Start Date:** April 23, 2024, 4:00 AM
- **End Date:** April 25, 2024, 4:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** April 23, 2024, 4:00 PM
- **Auto Review Launch:** Scheduled for the deadline

## Resources

Before diving in, ensure you're equipped with the following resources:

- **Promise**: Dive into the [Promise documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to understand its core concepts.
- **JavaScript Promise: An introduction**: Explore the basics of Promises with this [introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises).
- **Await & Async**: Familiarize yourself with the [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) and [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) operators.
- **Throw / Try**: Understand error handling in JavaScript with the [throw/try](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) statements.

## Learning Objectives

By the project's conclusion, you should confidently grasp the following:

1. **Promises Understanding**:
   - Know what Promises are, their purpose, and how they're used in asynchronous JavaScript.

2. **Promise Methods**:
   - Master the usage of `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods for effective Promise handling.
   - Explore the `every` method of the Promise object and its utility.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling strategies using the `throw` and `try` statements within Promise chains.

4. **Async/Await Mastery**:
   - Utilize the `await` operator to manage asynchronous code flow gracefully.
   - Define and implement async functions to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

## Conclusion

ES6 Promises form the backbone of modern JavaScript asynchronous programming. This project offers a hands-on opportunity to deepen your understanding of Promises and associated concepts. Best of luck on your journey to JavaScript proficiency! Happy coding!
